Subject: Glamorgan9 Haven Quay West 2025 bookings are now open

Hi {{.FirstName}},

As someone who has previously stayed at Glamorgan 9 Haven Quay West, I just thought I would email to let you know
that bookings are now open for 2025.  I do prefer to let to people who have preiously stayed, and who I know have left
it in good condition!

It's still our favourite holiday spot - nothing quite like New Quay with the views and the dolphins!

Do let me know if you would like to rebook this year - let me know dates and I'll see what we have available.

Also just to say that I do very good deals for longer stays outside of the peak period, so no harm in asking!

All the best,

Simon
